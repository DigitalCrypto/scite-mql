Scite Editor for Metaquotes MQL (Meta Trader 4)

A SciTE based app to allow more efficient editing of MetaQuotes MQL Language. 

This is a version is a fork of the original SciTE-MQL 1.5.0 found on Steve Hopwood's fantastic Forex website.
Special thanks to user w633 for all the ground work and the others who helped contribute to such a great idea.



#### Features
Most of us are probably using the crappy MetaEditor to code our EA's, and I am really fed up with it so I went ahead and integrated the IDE that I believe can help ease the pain and boost our productivity.

It's not as fancy as Eclipse or Visual Studio, but it achieved most functionalities I need. Some of the feature includes:

- Syntax Highlight (can still improve)
- Compiler integration (partially now)
- Function listing
- Autocomplete
- Parameter hint
- Help integration (press F1 on keyword brings up Help window)
- Bracket matching
- Block collapse / expand
- Snippet, abbreviation support
- Theming (not straightforward though)

It's an open source project and everyone is welcomed to contribute. The original project is located at [HERE](https://code.google.com/p/scite-mql/)

Goerge's post at [Steve Hopwood Forex](http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=26565#p26565) tells you how to make the editor compile indicator and script code.
